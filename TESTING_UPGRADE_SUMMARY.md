# Testing Upgrade Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive testing upgrade effort for the Back2Back project following the elimination of singleton dependencies and introduction of dependency injection.

## Issues Addressed
- **#59**: PlaybackCoordinator Completely Untested (189 lines)
- **#60**: AISongCoordinator Completely Untested (402 lines)
- **#61**: StringBasedMusicMatcher Completely Untested (230 lines)
- **#62**: TurnManager Has Only 2 Tests, 5 Commented Out
- **#63**: MusicKit Services Completely Untested (3 services, 502 lines)

## Changes Made

### 1. Mock Infrastructure Enhanced
**Files Created/Modified:**
- `Back2BackTests/Mocks/TestFixtures.swift` - NEW
  - Test data structures for normalization test cases
  - Queue status test cases
  - Persona fixtures
  - AI model configuration fixtures

- `Back2BackTests/Mocks/MockSessionStateManager.swift` - UPDATED
  - Added `currentTurn` property to match SessionService
  - Added `determineNextQueueStatus()` method
  - Added `determineNextQueueStatusCalled` tracking

### 2. Test Files Created

#### StringBasedMusicMatcherTests.swift - NEW
**Location:** `Back2BackTests/MusicMatching/StringBasedMusicMatcherTests.swift`

**Status:** Test structure complete, implementation pending MusicKit Song workaround

**Test Coverage Planned:**
- Unicode normalization (curly apostrophes, quotes, diacritics)
- "The" prefix removal
- Featuring artist variations (feat., ft., featuring, with)
- Ampersand conversion
- Abbreviation period removal
- Parenthetical stripping (Remastered, Live, Radio Edit)
- Part number removal (Pt. 1, Part 2)
- Exact match scoring (200 points = confidence 1.0)
- Partial match scoring (contains, contained by)
- Requirement for BOTH artist AND title match
- Confidence threshold enforcement (0.5)
- Top 3 results prioritization
- Full 200 results fallback
- Edge cases (empty results, no good match, multiple parentheticals)
- Real-world scenarios

**Critical Limitation Documented:**
MusicKit `Song` objects cannot be instantiated in unit tests. Test file includes comprehensive documentation of 4 solution options:
1. Protocol abstraction (recommended)
2. Integration tests on device
3. Record/replay pattern
4. Test normalization logic separately

### 3. Test Files Fixed

#### TurnManagerTests.swift - FIXED
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed all `.shared` singleton usage
- ✅ Now uses dependency injection with mocks
- ✅ Added 3 new tests (now 5 total, up from 2)
- ✅ All tests use `@MainActor` properly
- ✅ Tests use MockSessionStateManager directly for turn logic
- ✅ Added call tracking verification

**New Tests:**
1. `testDetermineNextQueueStatusDuringUserTurn` - Verifies user turn → .queuedIfUserSkips
2. `testDetermineNextQueueStatusDuringAITurn` - Verifies AI turn → .upNext
3. `testCurrentTurnStartsAsUser` - Verifies default state
4. `testQueueStatusFollowsTurnState` - Verifies turn → queue status mapping
5. `testAdvanceToNextSongNoQueue` - Verifies nil return for empty queue

**Still Commented Out (5 tests):**
- Tests requiring MusicKit Song objects
- Documented for future implementation via protocol abstraction

## Existing Tests Requiring Updates

The following test files still use `.shared` and need to be updated to use dependency injection:

1. **StatusMessageServiceTests.swift** - Uses StatusMessageService.shared
2. **OpenAIClientTests.swift** - May use service singletons
3. **PersonaServiceTests.swift** - Uses PersonaService.shared
4. **PersonaSongCacheServiceTests.swift** - Uses PersonaSongCacheService.shared
5. **SessionViewModelTests.swift** - Uses multiple .shared services
6. **EnvironmentServiceTests.swift** - Uses EnvironmentService.shared (9 instances)
7. **MusicServiceTests.swift** - Uses MusicService.shared
8. **OpenAISongSelectionTests.swift** - May use service singletons

## MusicKit Testing Challenge

**The Core Problem:**
MusicKit's `Song` type cannot be instantiated in unit tests because:
- No public initializer
- Populated only by MusicKit's internal catalog search
- Cannot create mocks or stubs

**Impact:**
- ~50% of desired tests cannot be implemented without a workaround
- Affects: TurnManager, PlaybackCoordinator, AISongCoordinator, SessionViewModel, StringBasedMusicMatcher

**Recommended Solutions (in priority order):**

### Option 1: Protocol Abstraction (Best for Unit Tests)
```swift
protocol SongProtocol {
    var id: String { get }
    var title: String { get }
    var artistName: String { get }
    // ... other required properties
}

extension Song: SongProtocol {}

struct MockSong: SongProtocol {
    let id: String
    let title: String
    let artistName: String
}
```

**Pros:**
- Fast unit tests
- No device needed
- Easy to test edge cases

**Cons:**
- Requires refactoring services to use SongProtocol
- Breaking change to architecture

### Option 2: Integration Tests on Device
Run subset of tests on physical device with real MusicKit.

**Pros:**
- Tests real behavior
- No architecture changes

**Cons:**
- Slow tests
- Requires device
- Requires Apple Music subscription
- Hard to test edge cases

### Option 3: Record/Replay Pattern
Record real MusicKit responses, replay in tests.

**Pros:**
- No architecture changes
- No device needed for tests

**Cons:**
- Recording step requires device
- Brittle (catalog changes)
- Maintenance overhead

### Option 4: Extract and Test Logic Separately (Quick Win)
Make string normalization functions public/internal and test directly.

**Pros:**
- Immediate value
- No architecture changes
- Tests critical logic

**Cons:**
- Doesn't test full integration
- Limited scope
