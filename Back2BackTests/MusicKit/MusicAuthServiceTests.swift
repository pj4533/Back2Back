        // Should match authorization status
        #expect(authorized == (service.authorizationStatus == .authorized))
    }

    // Note: We cannot test requestAuthorization() in unit tests because:
    // 1. It shows a system dialog
    // 2. Requires user interaction
    // 3. Only works on physical devices (not simulator)
    // 4. Needs actual Apple Music subscription

    // Integration tests on device would be needed to fully test authorization flow
}

// MARK: - Implementation Notes

/*
 TESTING LIMITATIONS:

 MusicAuthService wraps MusicKit's authorization system which:
 1. Shows system UI dialogs
 2. Requires user interaction
 3. Only works on physical devices with Apple Music
 4. Cannot be mocked easily without protocol abstraction

 CURRENT TESTS:
 - Service initialization
 - Authorization status checking
 - isAuthorized computed property

 CANNOT BE TESTED IN UNIT TESTS:
 - requestAuthorization() - requires system dialog and user interaction
 - Status change notifications
 - Deep linking to Settings

 FOR FULL COVERAGE:
 - Integration tests on physical device
 - UI automation tests for authorization flow
 - Protocol abstraction to allow mocking MusicAuthorization

 These tests verify the service can be created and provides status information,
 but the core authorization request flow requires integration testing.

 See Issue #63 for full implementation requirements.
