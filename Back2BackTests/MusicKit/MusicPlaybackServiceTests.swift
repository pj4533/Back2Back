    // Note: The following methods require actual MusicKit playback:
    // - playSong() - needs real Song object from catalog
    // - addToQueue() - needs real Song and active player
    // - togglePlayPause() - needs active playback
    // - skipToNext/skipToPrevious() - needs queue with songs
    // - seek() - needs active playback
    // - clearQueue() - needs active queue
    //
    // These cannot be tested in unit tests without:
    // 1. Protocol abstractions for ApplicationMusicPlayer
    // 2. Mock player implementation
    // 3. Integration tests on physical device
}

 TESTING LIMITATIONS:

 MusicPlaybackService wraps ApplicationMusicPlayer which:
 1. Requires real Song objects from MusicKit catalog
 2. Controls actual system music playback
 3. Cannot be instantiated or mocked easily
 4. Requires active Apple Music subscription
 5. Works best on physical devices

 CURRENT TESTS:
 - Service initialization
 - Initial state verification (playbackState, currentlyPlaying, currentSongId)
 - getCurrentPlaybackTime() when stopped

 CANNOT BE TESTED IN UNIT TESTS WITHOUT MAJOR REFACTORING:
 - playSong() - requires real Song object
 - addToQueue() - requires real Song and player state
 - togglePlayPause() - requires active playback
 - skipToNext/skipToPrevious() - requires queue with real songs
 - seek() - requires active playback
 - skipForward/skipBackward() - requires active playback
 - clearQueue() - requires active queue

 FOR FULL COVERAGE, WE NEED:
 - Protocol abstraction for ApplicationMusicPlayer
   ```swift
   protocol MusicPlayerProtocol {
       var state: ApplicationMusicPlayer.PlaybackStatus { get }
       var queue: ApplicationMusicPlayer.Queue { get }
       func play() async throws
       func pause() async throws
       // ... etc
   }
   ```
 - Mock player implementation for testing
 - Integration tests on physical device with real playback

 ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
 1. Extract player interface to protocol
 2. Inject player dependency rather than using ApplicationMusicPlayer.shared
 3. Create MockMusicPlayer for testing
 4. Test playback logic without actual music playback

 ALTERNATIVE TESTING APPROACHES:
 1. Record/Replay: Record real player interactions, replay in tests
 2. Integration Only: Accept that some code requires device testing
 3. Logic Extraction: Pull testable logic out of playback methods

 These tests verify the service can be created and reports initial state,
 but the core playback functionality requires either:
 - Significant architectural changes (protocol abstraction)
 - Integration testing on device
 - Acceptance of lower unit test coverage for this component

 See Issue #63 for full implementation requirements.
